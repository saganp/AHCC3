    <Name>Remittance</Name>
    <Description>A Remittance Advice (RA) is a document supplied by the insurance payer that provides notice of and explanation reasons for payment, adjustment,denial and/or uncovered charges of a medical claim.
Usually accompanies Medicare and Medicaid payments.
Often referred to as an explanation of payment by other insurance payers.

There are two types of RAs:

Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA): an RA that is transmitted in an electronic format
Standard Remittance Advice (SRA): an RA that is submitted in a paper format
Most insurance payers have implemented the use of the ERA. The benefits include the ability to post payment information automatically and quickly identify denials made during initial billing to make necessary corrections.

The ANSI 835 is the electronic payment and remittance advice standard format for health care claims. HIPAA regulations require the use of 835 as a set of rules to replace paper EOB's when health care providers receive electronic payments.

Remittance Advice should include some or all of the following information:

Payer Paid Amount: the dollar amount paid by the payer
Approved Amount: the approved amount equals the amount for the total claim that was approved by the payer
Allowed Amount: the allowed amount equals the amount for the total claim that was allowed by the payer
Patient Responsibility Amount: the amount of money that is the responsibility of the patient which represents the patient copay, coinsurance, and deductible amounts
Covered Amount: the covered amount equals the amount for the total claim that was covered by the payer
Discount Amount: the dollar value of the primary payer discount or contractual adjustment
Adjudication date: the date the claim was adjudicated and/or paid
The remittance advice may also show the payers internal control number (ICN), check number, service codes, description of services, denial reason codes, and remark explanations.

Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA)

Using electronic remittance advice (ERA) is a fast and accurate way to post your payments as well as adjustments and denials. The ERA, however, is not effective without the electronic funds transfer (EFT). EFT will assure that your payment will post directly to your bank account to reflect your ERA. You can sign up for these benefits directly or through a clearinghouse. The process will work similar to the electronic billing process.

Alternate Definition:  
A cost-sharing methodology where a flat rate paid per vist or item purchased is applied by the patient's insurance company.  This is a contractual obligation the patient has with the insurance and cannot be waived.  Co-Pays are independent of other cost-sharing methodologies (such as co-insurance and/or deductible) and typically do not 'count' in a patient's deductible amount or out of pocket maximum.   This can vary by payer and the individuals contract.</Description>
